🛡️ DHIP - Digital Harm Intelligence Platform

Transforming cyber safety from reactive response to predictive prevention

🎯 What is DHIP?
DHIP (Digital Harm Intelligence Platform) is an AI-powered, privacy-first cyber intelligence ecosystem that converts anonymous threat reports into collective protective intelligence. By analyzing patterns across scams, fraud, harassment, and impersonation attempts, DHIP identifies how digital threats evolve over time and geography—enabling the platform to warn users before they engage with malicious entities.
Unlike reactive security tools that respond only after victims suffer damage, DHIP learns from collective experiences to predict and prevent harm before it occurs. This shifts India's digital defense from individual vulnerability to community immunity.

🚨 The Problem
India is facing an unprecedented digital safety crisis:

847% surge in digital arrest scams between 2023 and 2024
₹120.3 crore lost to cyber fraud in Q1 2024 alone
68% of cyber crimes go unreported due to social stigma, privacy concerns, and lack of accessible reporting mechanisms
Existing cyber safety solutions are fundamentally reactive—they respond only after victims have already suffered devastating financial or emotional damage

No system exists that learns from collective victim experiences to predict and prevent digital harm before it occurs.

✨ Our Solution
DHIP provides a comprehensive cyber safety ecosystem with:
✅ Real-time threat detection for URLs, phone numbers, UPI IDs, and emails
✅ Predictive alerts about emerging scams in your region
✅ Stigma-free anonymous reporting for all demographics
✅ Digital Risk Scores (0-10 scale) to assess safety before engagement
✅ Pattern intelligence that learns how threats evolve and mutate
✅ Trauma-informed support systems for vulnerable populations
✅ Community immunity through collective protective intelligence

⛔ DO NOT enter your password or OTP

📊 CORE FEATURE 4: Pattern Confidence Engine (PCE)
Beyond Binary Detection: Probabilistic Threat Assessment
Calculates dynamic confidence scores (0-100%) that reflect uncertainty and evolving patterns:
Factors Analyzed:

Report frequency (normalized per 100k population)
Geographic clustering (concentrated vs. spread nationwide)
Temporal patterns (recent spike vs. sustained pattern)
Evidence quality (screenshots, call recordings, transaction proof)
Behavioral markers (script similarity to known templates)
Source diversity (age groups, genders, locations)

PCE Score Formula:
PCE = (0.25 × Frequency) + (0.20 × Geographic Spread) + 
      (0.20 × Recency) + (0.15 × Evidence Quality) + 
      (0.10 × Script Similarity) + (0.10 × Source Diversity)
Output Categories:

High Confidence (85-100%): "Verified scam pattern—127 reports with strong evidence"
Medium Confidence (50-84%): "Emerging threat—12 similar cases in last 48 hours"
Low Confidence (0-49%): "Isolated report—monitoring for patterns"

Why This Matters: Reduces false positives, provides transparency in risk assessment, builds user trust.

⏱️ CORE FEATURE 5: Temporal Mutation Detection (TMD)
Tracking How Scams Evolve Over Time
Scammers constantly adapt. TMD tracks scam families and predicts mutations using DBSCAN clustering and time-series analysis:
What TMD Detects:

Script Variations: "Your Aadhaar is blocked" → "Your PAN card is suspended" (same logic, different wording)
Geographic Spread: Scam starts in Delhi → spreads to Noida → now in Ghaziabad (predicts Meerut within 72 hours)
Timing Shifts: Calls initially 10 AM–2 PM, now also 8 PM–11 PM (targeting post-work professionals)
Target Profile Changes: Originally seniors (60+), now victims aged 25-35 (younger demographic shift)

Real-World Impact:
"Digital arrest scam mutated—now using 'Customs Department' 
impersonation instead of 'Police.' Detected in 5 new districts 
in 48 hours. 2,847 users warned before engagement."
